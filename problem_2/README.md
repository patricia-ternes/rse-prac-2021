# Problem 2

> See the problem_2 subdirectory.

A researcher you have met regularly runs several hundred samples through an analysis machine over the weekend. Most of the time each sample run completes fully, writing 100 values into a numbered file for that sample. Occasionally, a sample run fails and fewer than 100 values are written to a file.

Can you show this researcher how to quickly identify the sample files that have fewer than 100 values?
