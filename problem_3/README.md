# Problem 3

A researcher has approached you with a piece of Python code which seems to be running slower than she expects. The original code:

```python
1 |  def primes(n):
2 |     if n==2:
3 |         return [2]
4 |     elif n<2:
5 |         return []
6 |
7 |     s=range(3,n+1,2)
8 |     mroot = n ** 0.5
9 |     half=(n+1)//2-1
10|     i=0
11|     m=3
12| 
13|     while m <= mroot:
14|         if s[i]:
15|             j=(m*m-3)/2
16|             s[j]=0
17|             while j<half:
18|                 s[j]=0
19|                 j+=m
20|         i=i+1
21|         m=2*i+3
22|     return [2]+[x for x in s if x]
23| 
24|  primes(100)
```

She doesnâ€™t want you to fix the code, but would like you to explain some general principles she can apply herself to investigate the code and work out where the problems are.

What would you suggest?

## Solution

> To speed up any Python code four steps can be followed:

1. Before moving on to more advanced techniques, it is recommended to review the code, following a series of good practices. Some tips from these best practices (which lead to better code performance) are listed in the [General tips](#general-tips) session.
2. Once you have ensured that your code is *well written*, it is recommended to profile your code (see [CPU profiling](#cpu-profiling) and [Memory profiling](#memory-profiling) sessions).
3. It is possible to translate the Python function to an optimized code (see [Native-speed code](#native-speed-code) session).
4. Finally, it is possible to separate the running process in several processes to be run in parallel (see [Multiprocessing](#multiprocessing)).

### General tips

Quickly looking at the code three things catch my immediate attention:

1. Lines 7 (`s=range(3,n+1,2)`), 15 (`j=(m*m-3)/2`) and 16 (`s[j]=0`) indicates that the code was written in Python 2.
2. Line 7 (`s=range(3,n+1,2)`) assign a integer list to `s` instead an array.
3. Line 8 (`mroot = n ** 0.5`) is a homemade function that has an equivalent library function available.

These two practices, for example, are not ideal and can slow down your code. So, before moving on to more advanced techniques, it is necessary to ensure that the code is written in the best possible way. Below, some practices considered ideal will be presented.

#### Python version

> Every release is more optimized.

The latest version should have the best performance, so make sure you always use the latest version. At least choose Python 3 over Python 2.

#### Data structure

> Using the most appropriate data structure is critical to speed up the code.

Python has some built-in data structures (namely: list, tuple, set, and dictionary). It is also possible to use additional data structures by importing modules (like [NumPy array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) and [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)).

One of the most common mistakes is using the **list** structure for all cases. For example, if your list has elements of a single type (like real numbers), you might consider using a NumPy array to optimise the code.

#### Assign variables

> Avoid assign variables inside loops.

Variables assigned within loops are recreated whenever the loop is iterated.

> Multiple assignments

If there is more than one variable to assign, you can perform a multiple assignment. The code:

```python
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
```

is more efficient than

```python
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3
```
